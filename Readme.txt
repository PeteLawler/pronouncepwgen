KeePass Pronounceable Password Generator
Copyright (c) 2009 Jan Benjamin Engracia <jaybz.e@gmail.com>

This is a plugin for KeePass that allows generation of pronounceable passwords.
The pronounceability rules used by this plugin have been based on FIPS 181.

The plugin code itself came from another project I created; pwgenlib.net.  It
is being developed in parallel to this plugin and related improvements to
either project will be reflected on both.  You can find pwgenlib.net here:
<http://bitbucket.org/jaybz/pwgenlibnet/overview/>

REQUIREMENTS

This is a pre-release version of the plugin and requires a pre-release version
of KeePass.

INSTALLING

Just copy PronouncePwGen.dll to the same directory where KeePass.exe is located
and KeePass should automatically recognize and load the plugin.

USAGE

In the password generation menu, the Pronounceable Password Generator option
should appear in the custom algorithm drop down box.  Just select it and click
on the options button beside the drop down box if you wish to change the
password generation settings.

CREDITS

Many thanks to Dominik Reichl for creating KeePass Password Safe, without which,
this plugin would not exist.

I would also like to extend my thanks to the creator of the "Nuvola" icon set,
David Vignioni.  For more information, please refer to the included original
readme and license.
